###How to Contribute

All top level pages in the GitHub repository should be treated as a chapter of the PyCon Organizer Manual. If you think a topic merits it's own chapter, you can create a new markdown file. You will also need to update the Table of Contents in the [Introduction](introduction.md).

####Chapter Template

The basic structure for each chapter should adhere to the following template:

```
Chapter Title

Description of problem statement the chapter addresses.

Actionable Item 1

Description of the item in short prose. Keep the definition succinct and precise. If there is previously existing content that does a deep dive on the topic or a particular subject area expert link to that person in the format of: 

	"Definition of why the resource offers in-depth advice", [Name of Resource](Link to Resource).

... More Actionable Items ...

TODO: List of items that have yet to be addressed

```

####Adding Your Name to Manual

There is a chapter dedicated to [regional specific information](regional_specific_information.md). Beyond detailing information for regional specific considerations, it would be beneficial to have contact information for regional user groups or organizers that can answer questions. It is encouraged that, should you feel comfortable, you issue a pull request with your:

* Name
* Preferred Method of Communication (e.g. email)
* Any regional user group affiliation
* Questions or topics you are interested in helping with
