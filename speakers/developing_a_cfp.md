###Developing a CFP

####Writing a CFP

You have several things to consider when writing a CFP including how you make an accessible CFP that encourages submissions from different backgrounds with different levels of Python expertise. The more detailed information you can provide on what your conference is looking for and provide examples of proposals, the better you can expect your output to be.

####Offering Resources for Applicants on Writing a Proposal

Doug Hellman [wrote a blog post](https://doughellmann.com/blog/2011/10/18/how-i-review-a-pycon-talk-proposal/ ) about how he reviews PyCon talk proposals. Sarah Mei has written on what she has felt is [missing in conference proposals](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2014/04/07/what-your-conference-proposal-is-missing/). While Lynn Root has [brainstormed an approach to writing a PyCon proposal](http://www.roguelynn.com/words/brainstorm-writing-a-pycon-proposal/).

While there are several pieces of advice out there you can offer for applicants in writing a proposal, you want to focus on those that are applicable to the types of talks your conference is soliciting.
