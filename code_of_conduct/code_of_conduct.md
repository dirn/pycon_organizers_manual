###Code of Conduct

A written and well defined Code of Conduct available on the PyCon website are requirements for obtaining funding from the Python Software Foundation. [Incidents happen](http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201303/community_conduct_conflict_and_communication.html) and Code of Conducts are a way to mitigate, prevent, and address to them as them happen in a proactive way. There are several reasons why you want to have a Code of Conduct including, but not limited to:

* Clear precedent for dealing with incidents
* Way to provide a safe space for everyone
* Outline specific behaviors that are unacceptable
* Promote discourse around accessibility, acceptance

For a more detailed discussion on how to make your tech events more accessible and why accessibility matters you can reference Lacey Williams Henschel's ["Organizing More Accessible Tech Events"](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/organizing-more-accessible-tech-events ).

####What does the Code of Conduct need to consider?

TBD

Examples of other Code of Conducts:

* !!Con has a [Code of Conduct](http://bangbangcon.com/conduct.html) several conferences have made reference to and use as a starting point. 

####Does the event need more than the basic Python Code of Conduct?
